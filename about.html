<p>Hi, How are you ?</p>

<p>My name is Guilherme. I am a Solution Architect specializing in IAM (Identity and Access Management) and Integration. I work mainly with WSO2 products, where I have several certifications, including Solution Architect - Associate. I also work with Forgerock/Ping Identity products.</p>

<p>I have been working in IT since 2006, covering a variety of areas, from equipment maintenance to consulting. In the last 10 years, I have been working more actively with IAM and Integration. In projects, I work from the design of the architecture to the implementation of the project.</p>

<p>This blog aims to be a place for my personal studies and a place where I can "document" my labs and tests. If any content helps you on your journey, I will be happy!</p>
